A flooded deck can also overload a deck substation, so bypass switching may be required in such cases. Beware of extreme scrubber overload!</li>

				<li class="maptweak">Deck 1 - Xenoflora and Miscellaneous labs are now brighter. This should allow for scientists to actually see the things they work on. Robotics now has solid doors. Privacy windows are no longer thwarted by looking through the door-windows. Added a window to the mech bay side to compensate for the lack of visibility from that direction due to the door no longer having a window. Door to storage next to robotics actually opens for the roboticist now. Removed power cable to nowhere in deck 1 starboard fore maintenance. Swaps the filing cabinet and table in the morgue so that the paper bin, folder, and pen are actually accessible when someone is working in there.</li>

With enough skill (expert+ for most things) you can run specific commands (type man for a list) to do rudimentary sysadmin diagnostic tasks. Notably, with network access, you can ssh into terminals of other computers over the network. If you are unskilled, you may get various failure effects or just be unable to do anything.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Pulse now affects blood circulation. Lower pulse effectively lowers it and vice versa.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Extremely high pulse risks damaging the heart. Shouldn't be a lot, but it's there.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">As you lose blood oxygenation, your pulse tries to rise to compensate. Thready (>250) pulse will cause a cardiac arrest.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Inaprovaline tries to bring pulse to normal levels, either up or down. It also prevents thready pulse.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Heart stopping is slightly less 100% surefire, so if you manage to get heart restarted it might beat for few ticks first.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You no longer need lungs/mouth to give CPR, but you will only do the heart bit. Checks still apply for mouth-to-mouth.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Shock stage stars rising earlier now (30 damage vs 50) and can go bit higher than usual.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Painkillers speed changed. Now they ramp up slower if ingested, but stay longer. Opposite if injected.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Adds some goodies to survival boxes - inapro injector, food and light.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Changed how tramadol/oxycodone work a bit. They now have period for setting in and wearing off, gradually ramping power up/down. Those are short, ~20 seconds to reach max</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mixing those with alcohol is now as bad idea as it's supposed to be - increased liver damage and respiratory depression (harder time beathing) await you</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Inaprovaline helps against breathing effects of both mixing and ODing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There's now some effects based on how much you consume over time, rather than single dose. Effects stat at 15u with some slowdown and chance to start slurring, ramp up from there, with major slowdown and slurring after OD-worthy doses is metabolized.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Also ODing on those will give you even MORE painkilling effect! At a small cost of suffocating most likely, and don't even try doing that AND booze.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ships now have sensors. Overmap is dark by default, with known sectors emitting some light. Dust/rocks/ion block visibility. You can control the sensor with console(s) on the bridge, its power setting sets how far it will shine. Higher settings use /huge/ mounts of power so don't leave it running on those. Sensors also cannot run in non-vacuum.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Some improvements to helm console - now shows ETA to next grid, can set max speed for autopilot.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Engines are now buildable - there's circuitboards for them in Tech storage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Merchant prices are now slightly less wack, they use actual procs for deciding them, instead of selling containeres full of stuff at price of container only.</li>

For every unit or so metabolized, it mutates one limb. Once every limb mutated, there's a 10% every tick to fully mutate into a slimegirl. If you're lucky, you might mutate right before death and that'd heal your all wounds! That' a great idea!</li>

				<li class="rscadd">'Toxins' damage is now overall organ failure, basically sum of organ damage. Poisons will try to destroy liver and kidney first, and will damage the rest after those two are down. Some poisons go straight for vitals. Liver will heal self until it's too damaged.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">'Suffocation' damage is now used as modifier to your blood levels. If you don't get enough air, you get effects of low blood basically.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Defibs now restart failed hearts instead of reviving dead. Also named differently now.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Most scanner readouts are changed now. Instead of damage values they report vitals (pulse/blood pressure/brain activity) and general state of damage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A D R E N A L I N E. When you take a good chunk of damage at once (15 or more in one hit) you generate bit of adrenaline reagent according to damage taken. It acts like strong painkiller / pulse raiser for a tick or two, becoming weaker after that.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">FBPs and IPCs now have batteries in their chests. They have HYPERCELLS and drain when they stand (unbuckled) or move around (double drain then).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Sleepers now have stomach pumps, same as filtering but for ingested stuff.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cultists yo - sacrifice rune now works on someone in asystole rather than full braindeath. Knives now count for all steps needed to cut out the heart, and cult runes count as surgery spots. Just sayin'.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bunch of chems is different now. First off, none 'reduce' toxins damage, aside from peridaxon cause tht's organ damage now.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Peridaxon only treats brain damage if it's not too severe. Get Alkysine otherwise.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Alkysine will only work if brain is fully oxygenated, so refill blood and air first.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Dylovene removes toxic reagents from blood.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Dexlaine fools brain into thinking you got at least 50% of air you needed. For Dex+ it's 80%.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cryox/Clonex also have Dex/Dex+ effect respectively.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Inapro prevents suffocating while in asystole, slows pulse down (which slows bleeding a bit) and has mild painkiller effect as it did.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Bunch of virus changes. Buckle up, kiddo. Praise Nurgle</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Space Cold event. Spawns a harmless virus that can be treated with cold medicine. Unless you're irradiated and it mutates to kill everyone I guess.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds space cold medicine (dextra-something) to white first aid boxes. Can also be made by mixing paracetamol+sugar. Eating it will stop weak viruses symptoms from manifesting.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Humans now have crude immune system simulation. Keeping your immunity high makes it easier to shrug off viruses, extremely low (15% and less) immunity can get you random space cold-level infections. Get lemons for boosting it, spaceacilin ruins it. It recovers to norm over time.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spaceacillin now ODs at 15u instead of 30u.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spaceacillin now metabolizes faster. It was 60+ minutes for 15u, 30 minutes now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spaceacillin boosts immune system effective rating. It acts as a multiplier to natural one, from 1x at none in blood to 2x at OD threshold (15u), and you can go higher if you don't mind ODing. Also if natural immunity is lower than the boost, boost would just replace it.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spaceacillin has three stages now. Below 10 units it acts kinda like now, blocking badness 2 virus effects. Virus would still progress though, but effects won't fire. It's enough for any random event virus effects.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Above 10 units it would completely stop progression of badness 2 viruses and stop effects of badness 3 - which is usual stuff ou get from viro labs. Again, clock will still be ticking. Also at this stage it starts lowering your natural immunity value.</li>
				<li class="tweak">And then, there's OD. OD stops badness 4 (e.g. Gibbingtons) from manifesting, and stops ticking of lower viruses. It screws your immune system even stronger too.</li>
				<li class="tweak">It's also not 100% protecting you from infection now. 15u and above give old 100% protection, scaling with lower value in blood.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some tweaks to virus annoyningness. Hard delay between firings (25-40 seconds between message-only syndromes), emote syndromes (groaning, moaning, screaming) are now single syndrome to make it rarer. Internals actually stopping you from spreading viruses. No airborne viruses in vacuum.</li>
				<li class="tweak">As an unrealated bonus, first aid (white and fire) boxes now have paracetamol bottles because damn it's easier to score opiates than that.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Oh also remember how when you graft yourself Tajaran arms it kills you? Not when your immunity is floored. Just saying.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Blobs are now considerably more resistant to energetic weapons, be it handheld lasers, energy guns, or even emitters. An emitter is still useful to suppress the blob a bit, but one emitter shouldn't be capable of outright killing the blob.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blob has a relatively small chance to grow secondary cores. These cores are considerably weaker, have lower health, but still help spread the blob a bit more.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Emitter power usage increased (30kW to 100kW). While it is still possible to run one with PACMAN, you have to keep it on overload.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reinforced walls are now considerably more resistant against projectiles of all kinds, be it emitters, handheld weaponry, or anything else. Regular walls are unaffected. An emitter is still useful if you need to burn through one, but expect to wait - it needs over fifty pulses for a plasteel reinforced wall.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Details on the above. Reinforcement is calculated from the material that is used to reinforce the girders when building the wall. Weak materials such as wood have 0% reduction in taken damage. Most basic materials have 50% or so. Steel is decent material with 80% reduction. Plasteel is very good with 90%, and titanium is the best with approx. 92% reduction (though it has lower overall health)</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed bubble shield generators, hull shield generators and shield capacitors. Also removed shield disrupter.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a replacement advanced shield generator, that has a combined function of a capacitor, and both shield generators (hull shielding is toggleable). This shield generator must be built and once constructed is immobile (but can be deconstructed again). These generators are fully configurable, have better hull shielding that doesn't block shuttles, mass drivers and others, and have different energy system. Damage will drain the shield's energy directly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Shield Diffusers. Two variants exist - floor mounted and handheld. The handheld variant can be purchased from traitor uplink, and runs on an internal cell. The floor mounted variant layers under floor tiles and is APC powered. These diffusers dissipate shields in adjacent tiles (+ shaped pattern). The generator can be set to try to counter these, in which case each diffuser causes major EM strain on the shield.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added two shield generator circuit boards and two shield diffuser circuit boards into tech storage.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Following the complains from humanitarian organizations regarding securitron brutality, stength of their stunners has been toned down. They will also politely demand that you get on the floor before arresting you. Except for the taser-mounted guys, they will still tase you down.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">INCOMING TRANSMISSION: Greetings to agents, pirates, operatives, and anyone who otherwise uses our equipment. Following the NT update of bot firmware, we have updated the cryptographic sequencer's hacking routines as well. The medbots you emag will not poison you anymore, the clanbots won't clean after themselves immediately, and floorbots... wear a space suit. Oh, and it works on the new farmbots, too.</li>
