	description = "The Tajaran are a mammalian species resembling roughly felines, hailing from Meralar in the Rarkajar system. \
	While reaching to the stars independently from outside influences, the humans engaged them in peaceful trade contact \
	and have accelerated the fledgling culture into the interstellar age. Their history is full of war and highly fractious \
	governments, something that permeates even to today's times. They prefer colder, tundra-like climates, much like their \
	home worlds and speak a variety of languages, especially Siik and Akhani."
