	with some vassal clans being the first to submit to the SCG, gaining freedom from their former lords. \

	In spite of this, those lords act more suspicious of humanity than most, and many suspect they intentionally offered more troops\

	true not only for those living in the deltas and estuaries of the Salt Swamps the birthplace of yeosa'unathi race but also for those settling in proximity \
	of major ports belonging to the Diamond Peaks (Gazalor) and other ethnic groups. Those coastal yeosa are generally known to the outsiders as yeosa littoral, or simply littorals - a name rarely used by the islanders themselves. \
	While the name implies that yeosa in question are lagoon-bound, this may often not be the case; ties with the land-dwellers, or lack thereof, have \
	also been used as a criterion, although less so in recent years. What is true, however, is that the littoral clans have adopted some sinta ways of life \
	through their constant mingling with the outsiders, integrating not only some elements of continental cults and festivities, but also the newer political ideas, such as \
	clan leagues, city-states and the Krukzuz. Technology works the same way - just as the well-preserved units of precursor crafts found their way to \
	the poles and the peaks, off-world and polar-produced flechette pistols and wetsuits became more commonplace in littoral areas as well."
