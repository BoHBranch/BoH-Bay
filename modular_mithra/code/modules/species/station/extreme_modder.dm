	description = "This is a genemodded species - a descendent divergent from any core species by means of genetic modification. It can also work as \
	subspecies or hybrid of some sorts. Here you can assign various gene traits to them as you wish, to create \
	a (hopefully) balanced genemodder. You will see the options to customize them on the Genemods tab once \
	you select and set this species as your species, so please, look into here if you select this. \
	Aberrations are considered an extreme form of Genemodding and have more restrictions, but also more customization."*/
